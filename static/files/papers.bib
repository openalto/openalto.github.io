  abstract = {Providing an interface for network applications to access network state, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) northbound API protocol is the foundation for the development of programmable networks with adaptive applications. However, with the growing network scale and applications' need for routing state at multi-domain level, feeding complete routing states to applications would jeopardize their scalability and network providers' privacy. Thus a good routing state abstraction is needed, which must be on-demand so that different applications can receive customized abstract state suiting their needs. Moreover, it must be minimal and equivalent, i.e., containing all the necessary information for applications to make decisions as the complete state does with no redundancy. Current routing state abstractions are not on-demand, and adopt extreme aggregation approaches (e.g., the big switch) to provide a minimal abstraction with the price of severe information loss. For instance, bottleneck links shared between flows are concealed, leading applications to make sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we design ORSAP, the first on-demand routing state abstraction protocol, through which network applications can describe their demands while Internet service providers can provide the on-demand minimal equivalent routing state accordingly. ORSAP ensures applications' scalability, protects network providers' privacy, and significantly reduces the traffic to disseminate the information. Experiments show that with ORSAP and the abstraction engine we introduced in this paper, one can achieve a state abstraction ratio of up to 60{\%} with an extremely low computation time even with large networks and complex application queries.},

  abstract = {As many applications today migrate to distributed computing and cloud platforms, their user experience depends heavily on network performance. Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes it possible to obtain a global view of the network, introducing the new paradigm of developing adaptive applications with network views. A naive approach of realizing the paradigm, such as distributing the whole network view to applications, is not practical due to scalability and privacy concerns. Existing approaches providing network abstractions are limited to special cases, such as bottlenecks exist only at networks edges, resulting in potentially suboptimal or infeasible decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel, on-demand network abstraction service that provides an abstract network view supporting not only accurate end-to-end QoS metrics, which satisfy the requirements of many peer-to-peer applications, but also multi-flow correlation, which is essential for bandwidth-sensitive applications containing many flows to conduct global network optimization. We prove that our abstract view is equivalent to the original network view, in the sense that applications can make the same optimal decision as with the complete information. Our evaluations demonstrate that the abstraction guarantees feasibility and optimality for network optimizations and protects the network service providers' privacy. Our evaluations also show that the service can be implemented efficiently; for example, for an extreme large network with 30,000 links and abstraction requests containing 3,000 flows, an abstract network view can be computed in less than one second.},

@inproceedings{Prophet2018,
  abstract = {As modern network applications (e.g., large data analytics) become more distributed and can conduct application-layer traffic adaptation, they demand better network visibility to better orchestrate their data flows. As a result, the ability to predict the available bandwidth for a set of flows has become a fun- damental requirement of today’s networking systems. While there are previous studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify three challenges in providing throughput prediction for reactive flows: throughput dynamics, heterogeneous reactive control mechanisms, and source-constrained flows. Based on a previous theoretical model, we introduce a novel learning- based prediction system with a key component named fast factor learning (FFL) model. We adopt novel techniques to overcome practical concerns such as scalability, convergence and unknown system parameters. A system, Prophet, is proposed leveraging the emerging technologies of Software Defined Networking (SDN) to realize the model. Evaluations demonstrate that our solution achieves significant accuracy in a wide range of settings.},

@inproceedings{SFP2018,
  abstract = {Interdomain routing using BGP is widely deployed and well understood. The deployment of SDN in BGP domain networks, however, has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we first show that the use-announcement inconsistency is a fundamental mismatch in such a deployment, leading to serious issues including unnecessary blackholes, unnecessary reduced reachability, and permanent forwarding loops. We then design SFP, the first fine-grained interdomain routing protocol that extends BGP with fine-grained routing, eliminating the aforementioned mismatch. We develop two novel techniques, automatic receiver filtering and on-demand information dissemination, to address the scalability issue brought by fine-grained routing. Evaluating SFP using real network topologies and traces for intended settings, which are not global Internet but tens of collaborative domains, we show that SFP can reduce the amount of traffic affected by blackholes and loops by more than 50{\%}, and that our proposed techniques can reduce the amount of signaling between ASes by 3 orders of magnitude compared with naive fine-grained routing.},

A major lacking of such systems, however, is that they are based on coarse-grained or localized information, resulting in substantial inefficiencies. In this paper, we present Explorer, a simple, novel, highly efficient multi-domain network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource information, to support high-performance, collaborative data sciences. The core component of Explorer is the use of linear inequalities, referred to as resource state abstraction (ReSA), as a compact, unifying representation of multi-domain network available bandwidth, which simplifies applications without exposing network details. We develop a ReSA obfuscating protocol and a proactive full-mesh ReSA discovery mechanism to ensure the privacy-preserving and scalability of Explorer. We fully implement Explorer and demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy through extensive experiments using real network topologies and traces.},

  abstract={Revealing an abstract view of the network is essential for the new paradigm of developing network-aware adaptive applications that can fully leverage the available computation and storage resources and achieve better business values. In this paper, we introduce ONV, a novel abstraction of flow-based on-demand network view. The ONV models network views as linear constraints on network-related variables in application-layer objective functions, and provides “equivalent” network views that allow applications to achieve the same optimal objectives as if they have the global information. We prove the lower bound for the number of links contained in an equivalent network view, and propose two algorithms to effectively calculate on-demand equivalent network views. We evaluate the efficacy and the efficiency of our algorithms extensively with real-world topologies. Evaluations demonstrate that the ONV can simplify the network up to 80% while maintaining an equivalent view of the network. Even for a large network with more than 25 000 links and a request containing 3000 flows, the result can be effectively computed in less than 1 min on a commodity server.},

@article{Unicorn2019,
 abstract = {As the data volume increases exponentially over time, data-intensive analytics benefits substantially from multi-organizational, geographically-distributed, collaborative computing, where different organizations contribute various yet scarce resources, e.g., computation, storage and networking resources, to collaboratively collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts of data. By analyzing the data analytics trace from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the largest scientific experiments in the world, and systematically examining the design of existing resource management systems for clusters, we show that the multi-domain, geo-distributed, resource-disaggregated nature of this new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of different domains, and that the fundamental challenge for designing such a framework is: how to accurately discover and represent resource availability of a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources across different domains with minimal information exposure from each domain? Existing resource management systems are designed for single-domain clusters and cannot address this challenge. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics. In Unicorn, we encode the resource availability for each domain into resource state abstraction, a variant of the network view abstraction extended to accurately represent the availability of multiple resources with minimal information exposure using a set of linear inequalities. We then design a novel, efficient cross-domain query algorithm and a privacy-preserving resource information integration protocol to discover and integrate the accurate, minimal resource availability information for a set of data analytics jobs across different domains. In addition, Unicorn also contains a global resource orchestrator that computes optimal resource allocation decisions for data analytics jobs. We implement a prototype of Unicorn and present preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy. We also give a full demonstration of the Unicorn system at SuperComputing 2017.},

  abstract = {End-to-end route control spanning a set of networkscan provide opportunities to both end users to optimize in-terdomain control and network service providers to increasebusiness offering. BGP, the de facto interdomain routing pro-tocol, provides no programmable control. Recent proposals forinterdomain control, such as MIRO, ARROW and SDX, providemore mechanisms and interfaces, but they are only either pointor incremental solutions. In this paper, we provide the first,systematic formulation of thesoftware-defined  internetworking(SDI)model, in which a network exposes a programmableinterface to allow clients to define the interdomain routes ofthe network, just as a traditional SDN switch exposes Openflowor another programmable interface to allow clients to define itsnext hops, extending SDN from intra-domain control to genericinterdomain control. Different from intradomain SDN, whichallows complete client control, SDI should also maximize networkautonomy, such as by allowing a network to maintain the controlof its interdomain export policies, to avoid fundamental violationssuch as valley routing. We define theoptimal  end-to-end  SDIrouting  problemand conduct rigorous analysis to show thatthe problem is NP-hard. We develop a blackbox optimizationalgorithm, which leverages Bayesian optimization theory andimportant properties of interdomain routing algebra, to sampleend-to-end routes sequentially and find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route with a small number of sampleroutes. We implement a prototype of our optimization algorithmand validate its effectiveness via extensive experiments usingreal interdomain network topology. Results show that in aninterdomain network with over 60000 ASes and over 320000 AS-level links, in 80% experiment cases, the blackbox optimizationalgorithm can find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-endroute by sampling less than 33 routes.},
