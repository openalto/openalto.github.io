abstract: "The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] protocol provides network related information, called network information resources, to client applications so that clients can make informed decisions in utilizing network resources. This document presents a mechanism to allow an ALTO server to push updates to ALTO clients, to achieve two benefits: (1) updates can be incremental, in that if only a small section of an information resource changes, the ALTO server can send just the changes; and (2) updates can be immediate, in that the ALTO server can send updates as soon as they are available."
