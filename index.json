BGP, the de facto interdomain routing protocol, provides no programmable control. Recent proposals for interdomain control, such as MIRO, ARROW and SDX, provide more mechanisms and interfaces, but they are only either pointor incremental solutions. In this paper, we provide the first,systematic formulation of thesoftware-defined  internetworking(SDI)model, in which a network exposes a programmable interface to allow clients to define the interdomain routes of the network, just as a traditional SDN switch exposes Openflowor another programmable interface to allow clients to define its next hops, extending SDN from intra-domain control to generic interdomain control. Different from intradomain SDN, which allows complete client control, SDI should also maximize network autonomy, such as by allowing a network to maintain the control of its interdomain export policies, to avoid fundamental violations such as valley routing. We define the optimal  end-to-end  SDIrouting  problem and conduct rigorous analysis to show that the problem is NP-hard. We develop a blackbox optimization algorithm, which leverages Bayesian optimization theory and important properties of interdomain routing algebra, to sample end-to-end routes sequentially and find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route with a small number of sample routes. We implement a prototype of our optimization algorithm and validate its effectiveness via extensive experiments using real interdomain network topology. Results show that in an interdomain network with over 60000 ASes and over 320000 AS-level links, in 80% experiment cases, the blackbox optimization algorithm can find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route by sampling less than 33 routes.","tags":null,"title":"Toward Optimal Software-Defined Interdomain Routing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586799137,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586799137,"objectID":"52862af89900ad8731d30cb3e8de51bc","permalink":"/project/alto-internet/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T13:32:17-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/alto-internet/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["internet"],"title":"Traffic Optimization over Internet","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586796345,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586796345,"objectID":"b728519a758a4d65a17d3837365841bc","permalink":"/project/netml/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T12:45:45-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/netml/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["machine learning"],"title":"Machine Learning for Data Science Network","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586794877,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586794877,"objectID":"4bb08fdc0137b2366297261d043709fe","permalink":"/project/multidomain-alto/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T12:21:17-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/multidomain-alto/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["exascale data science","multidomain"],"title":"Resource Discovery and Orchestration for Exascale Multidomain Data Sciences","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sebastian Kiesel","Martin Stiemerling"],"categories":["rfc"],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"8bf52642e9ded171796049cb3b58cb1e","permalink":"/publication/rfc-8686/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T19:26:35.176199Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rfc-8686/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.

By analyzing the data analytics trace from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the largest scientific experiments in the world, and systematically examining the design of existing resource management systems for clusters, we show that the multi-domain, geo-distributed, resource-disaggregated nature of this new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of different domains, and that the fundamental challenge for designing such a framework is: how to accurately discover and represent resource availability of a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources across different domains with minimal information exposure from each domain? Existing resource management systems are designed for single-domain clusters and cannot address this challenge. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics. In Unicorn, we encode the resource availability for each domain into resource state abstraction, a variant of the network view abstraction extended to accurately represent the availability of multiple resources with minimal information exposure using a set of linear inequalities. We then design a novel, efficient cross-domain query algorithm and a privacy-preserving resource information integration protocol to discover and integrate the accurate, minimal resource availability information for a set of data analytics jobs across different domains. In addition, Unicorn also contains a global resource orchestrator that computes optimal resource allocation decisions for data analytics jobs. We implement a prototype of Unicorn and present preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy.

While there are previous studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify three challenges in providing throughput prediction for reactive flows: throughput dynamics, heterogeneous reactive control mechanisms, and source-constrained flows.

Existing approaches providing network abstractions are limited to special cases, such as bottlenecks exist only at networks edges, resulting in potentially suboptimal or infeasible decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel, on-demand network abstraction service that provides an abstract network view supporting not only accurate end-to-end QoS metrics, which satisfy the requirements of many peer-to-peer applications, but also multi-flow correlation, which is essential for bandwidth-sensitive applications containing many flows to conduct global network optimization. We prove that our abstract view is equivalent to the original network view, in the sense that applications can make the same optimal decision as with the complete information. Our evaluations demonstrate that the abstraction guarantees feasibility and optimality for network optimizations and protects the network service providers' privacy.

However, with the growing network scale and applications' need for routing state at multi-domain level, feeding complete routing states to applications would jeopardize their scalability and network providers' privacy. Thus a good routing state abstraction is needed, which must be on-demand so that different applications can receive customized abstract state suiting their needs. Moreover, it must be minimal and equivalent, i.e., containing all the necessary information for applications to make decisions as the complete state does with no redundancy. Current routing state abstractions are not on-demand, and adopt extreme aggregation approaches (e.g., the big switch) to provide a minimal abstraction with the price of severe information loss. For instance, bottleneck links shared between flows are concealed, leading applications to make sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we design ORSAP, the first on-demand routing state abstraction protocol, through which network applications can describe their demands while Internet service providers can provide the on-demand minimal equivalent routing state accordingly. ORSAP ensures applications' scalability, protects network providers' privacy, and significantly reduces the traffic to disseminate the information.

For example, views to Internet routing tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words, what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in this document provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize them. Additional services are built on top of the maps. This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could also provide ALTO services. Applications that could use the ALTO services are those that have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.","tags":null,"title":"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Kiesel","Stefano Previdi","Martin Stiemerling","Richard Woundy","Y.

This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource. This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate goal is to improve performance or Quality of Experience in the application while reducing the utilization of the underlying network infrastructure.

Such applications often transfer large amounts of data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying network topology. Some applications are so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange data. Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often make less than desirable choices. This document discusses issues related to an information-sharing service that enables applications to perform better-than-random peer selection.
