	abstract =	{The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework {[}RFC6707{]} defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs, to achieve multiple goals such as extending the reach of a given CDN to areas that are not covered by that particular CDN. One component that is needed to achieve the goal of CDNI described in {[}RFC7336{]} is the CDNI Request Routing Footprint \& Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). {[}RFC8008{]} defines precisely the semantics of FCI and provides guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is explicitly outside the scope of that document. This document defines an FCI protocol using the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol, following the guidelines defined in {[}RFC8008{]}.},

	abstract =	{This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol. It extends the ALTO cost information service so that applications decide not only 'where' to connect, but also 'when'. This is useful for applications that need to perform bulk data transfer and would like to schedule these transfers during an off-peak hour, for example. This extension introduces ALTO Cost Calendar, with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost values in JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval. The time intervals as well as other Calendar attributes, are specified in the Information Resources Directory and ALTO Server responses.},

	abstract =	{The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) {[}RFC7285{]} protocol provides network related information, called network information resources, to client applications so that clients can make informed decisions in utilizing network resources. This document presents a mechanism to allow an ALTO server to push updates to ALTO clients, to achieve two benefits: (1) updates can be incremental, in that if only a small section of an information resource changes, the ALTO server can send just the changes; and (2) updates can be immediate, in that the ALTO server can send updates as soon as they are available.},

	abstract =	{This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization protocol {[}RFC7285{]}. The current ALTO Cost Services allow applications to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path defined by its source and destination. The present extension provides abstracted information on particular network parts or elements traversed by a path between its source and destination. Examples of such abstracted parts are networks, data centers or links. This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by particular network parts they traverse or by their properties. Applications having the choice among several connection paths may use this information to select paths accordingly and improve their performance. In particular, they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This document introduces a new cost type called Path Vector. A Path Vector is an array of entities that each identifies an abstracted representation of a network part and that are called Abstract Network Element (ANE). Each ANE is defined by a set of properties. ANE properties are conveyed by an ALTO information resource called "Property Map", that can be packed together with the Path Vectors in a multipart response. They can also be obtained via a separate ALTO request to a Property Map. An ALTO Property Map is an extension to the ALTO protocol, that is specified in another document entitled "Unified Properties for the ALTO Protocol" {[}I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new{]}.},

	day =		9,
	abstract =	{Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO), and is used in basic ALTO services including both the cost map service and the endpoint cost service. Different applications may use different cost metrics, but the ALTO base protocol {[}RFC7285{]} documents only one single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric; see Sec. 14.2 of {[}RFC7285{]}. Hence, if the resource consumer of an application prefers a resource provider that offers low-delay delivery to the resource consumer, the base protocol does not define the cost metric to be used. ALTO cost metrics can be generic metrics and this document focuses on network performance metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop count, and bandwidth. When using an ALTO performance metric, an application may need additional contextual information beyond the metric value. For example, whether the metric is an estimation based on measurements or a service-level agreement (SLA) can define the meaning of a performance metric. Hence, this document introduces an additional "cost-context" field to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey such information. To report an estimated value of a performance metric, the ALTO server may derive and aggregate from routing protocols with different granularity and scope, such as BGP-LS, OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end-to-end traffic management tools. These metrics may then be exposed by an ALTO Server to allow applications to determine "where" to connect based on network performance criteria.},
